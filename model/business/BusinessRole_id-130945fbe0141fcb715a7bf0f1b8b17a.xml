    documentation="A role played by an Entity when it is issued a Credential by an Issuer. The Holder may or may not be the Subject of the Credential. (There are many use cases in which the Holder is not the Subject, e.g., a birth certificate where the Subject is a baby and both the mother and father may be Holders. Another case is a Credential Registry.) If the Credential supports Zero Knowledge Proofs, the Holder is also the Prover. Based on the definition provided by the W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group. See Appendix G.">
