    documentation="A digital assertion containing a set of Claims made by an Entity about itself or another Entity. Credentials are a subset of Identity Data. A Credential is based on a Credential Definition. The Entity described by the Claims is called the Subject of the Credential. The Entity creating the Credential is called the Issuer. The Entity holding the issued Credential is called the Holder. If the Credential supports Zero Knowledge Proofs, the Holder is also called the Prover. The Entity to whom a Credential is presented is generally called the Relying Party, and specifically called the Verifier if the Credential is a Verifiable Credential. Once issued, a Credential is typically stored by an Agent. (In Sovrin Infrastructure, Credentials are not stored on the Sovrin Ledger.) Examples of Credentials include college transcripts, driver licenses, health insurance cards, and building permits. See also Verifiable Credential. See Appendix A and Appendix G.">
